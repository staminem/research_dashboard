# research_dashboard
Python code for a research dashboard comparing scientific publications from PubMed and rating them among each other.

Download and install the necessary libraries and dependencies.

Run main.py.

Click on the link provided in the python console. This should open the initial form in your default browser.

Enter a valid email address and a name for the tool/research project in the respective form fields.

Enter PubMed Ids by entering the number, then hitting space. You can copy and paste a number of PubMed IDs if they are separated by whitespace. This is crucial since any input will be turned into a tag. The separator for multiple tags is configured to be whitespace.

Enter keywords relevant to your search in the same fashion as PubMed IDs outlined above.

Click "Submit" or hit enter on your keyboard.

Wait for the code to finish processing the data and explore the table created as well as the data visualisations (radar and bar plot).
